        I am interested in the production and hatching of daphnia resting eggs, and investigating the environmental cues involved in the differing responses between clonal lineages. As part of this, I am also interested in how populations of daphnia maintain genetic diversity over longer timescales. Previously, I worked on image collection and analysis of _Daphnia pulex_ neonates exposed to predator kairomones, to measure the plastic response of necktooth induction.

      profile: |
        Dr. Karen Barnard-Kubow is interested in the processes underlying the generation and maintenance of genetic variation, and how genetic divergence may eventually lead to the formation of new species. For her PhD with [Laura Galloway](https://gallowaylab.weebly.com/) she worked on cytonuclear incompatibility and speciation in an herbaceous plant species. She conducted post-doctoral research with [Ben Blackman](https://plantandmicrobiology.berkeley.edu/profile/bblackman) examining the genetic architecture of photoperiod in wild populations of sunflowers. Her current research is focused on understanding how the interplay between ecology and reproductive polymorphism influences the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations of the model facultative parthenogen, _Daphnia pulex_.

        Priscilla is interested in studying how organisms survive in changing environments. She focuses on the genetic basis of traits related to cold tolerance and overwintering in fruit flies, using a combination of field work, lab experiments, and genomics. Starting in 2021, Priscilla will have her own lab at the University of Richmond, where she will work with undergraduates to study evolutionary genetics in the invasive fruit fly _Zaprionus indianus_.

        Dr. Dörthe Becker is a physiological ecologist interested in the molecular mechanisms by which various stressors are tolerated via acclimation. During her PhD, her research focused on highly conserved stress-induced signaling processes that enable Daphnia to adequately adjust their physiological performance upon environmental change. For her subsequent post-doctoral research with [Andrew Beckerman](https://www.beckslab.staff.shef.ac.uk/) and [John Colbourne](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/colbourne-john.aspx) she broadened her research towards the field of environmental genomics in order to explore the regulatory mechanisms that provide the basis for tolerance, acclimation and phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, her research on different Daphnia genotypes investigated the molecular signatures of predator induced changes in life history and morphology, with particular focus on how these responses are modified by other environmental contaminants (e.g. metals). Her research in the Bergland lab will continue this line of research as part of the on-going project on dynamics of predation induced adaptation in Daphnia.

        My research studies patterns of genetic variation in natural populations living  in highly variable environments. I seek to characterize what loci are under selection at different scales of environmental heterogeneity both in space and time. My research program seeks to determine the identity of these ecologically important loci, as well as the mechanisms that underlie their maintenance of genetic variation. I did my PhD at Brown with David M. Rand woking on intertidal barnacles. I did my undergraduate at the University of Miami with  Margie F. Oleksiak and Doug L. Crawford working on killifish.

She is broadly interested in how populations adapt to their environments and is currently interested in how they adapt to their environments in the short term. For her Ph.D. dissertation work, Alyssa does very fine-scale temporal sampling of wild Drosophila melanogaster to look at seasonal evolution. She is also investigating how other Drosophilids may evolve seasonally. Alyssa just wrapped up her 5th and final year as a [Jefferson Fellow](https://www.jeffersonscholars.org/), which has in part supported her research.

      profile: I am interested in understanding how Drosophila melanogaster populations adapt to spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. My current projects are looking at 1. Adaptive signals and genetic mechanisms underlying local adaptation at functional genetic loci; 2. Relative contributions of genetic adaptation and plasticity to seasonal fitness-related traits; 3. Seasonal gene expression patterns and the evolutionary trajectory of the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).

        Connor Murray is a Ph.D. student studying the evolutionary forces that generate and maintain diversity in the wild. Using population genomics and phenomics, he hopes to better understand how genetic diversity is influenced by competition, demographics, and sexual recombination. Future experiments will involve large scale genomics and implement technology that is cross-disciplinary to assist him in gathering high-quality data for his dissertation research. Current work has him quantifying the properties of mutation accumulation within a wild _Daphnia pulex_ population in England.
