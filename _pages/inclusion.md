The Bergland lab is committed to providing a diverse and supportive laboratory environment. <br><br>
We aim to (1) be an inclusive environment, regardless of age, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital status, family structure, disability, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or socio-economic background; (2) respect individual needs, styles, and career goals and mentor accordingly; (3) challenge each other to grow and learn as scientists and as humans; (4) be accountable to each other. <br><br>
We support the Biology Department Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion [[link]](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/content/department-biology-statement-diversity-equity-and-inclusion) and will work to advance the specific goals outlined in the Biology Departmentâ€™s Action plan [[link]](https://bio.as.virginia.edu/sites/bio.as.virginia.edu/files/Biology%20Diversity%20Goals_Ver%202_073120_0.pdf).
