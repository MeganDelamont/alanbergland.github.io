I am currently accepting graduate students interested in studying the molecular basis and evolutionary dynamics of adaptation in the wild. Prospective students should consult the Biology Department's graduate admissions [site](http://bio.as.virginia.edu/graduate). If you are interested in applying to the Biology department at UVa and joining my lab, please get in touch with me directly.
