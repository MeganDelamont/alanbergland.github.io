Karen Barnard-Kubow, a postdoc in the Bergland Lab, was recently awarded a NIH NRSA postdoctoral fellowship. The fellowship will support her research examining how mixed reproductive strategies may act as a mechanism of balancing selection in cyclic parthenogens, and assessing the impact of this balancing selection on patterns of genetic diversity genome-wide.
