Dörthe Becker, a postdoc in the Bergland lab, was recently awarded a Horizon2020 Marie SkŁodowska Curie fellowship funded by the European Commission. The fellowship will support her research examining how local adaptation affects sex and dormancy strategies in the ecological and genomic model organism Daphnia. Specifically, Dörthe will investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive sex specialization, and assess how environmental heterogeneity is contributing to genetic variation within and across natural populations.
