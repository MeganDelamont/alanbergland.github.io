Former PhD student Cory Weller publishes work evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of association mapping in outbred population.

This work shows taht fully-phased genomes can be reconstructed from arbitrarily large multiparental mapping populations. This work also shows that association mapping in inbred panels could lead to high false positive rates and that this problem is ameliorated through a limited number of generations of outbreeding. We use this "Hybrid Swarm" approach to study the genetics of diapause in Erickson et al (2020).
