### Evolution in your backyard
For many plants, animals, and fungi, we think of the seasons as a cycle of growth and dormancy. What is growth? For an individual, growth is the transition from one stage of life to another; the accumulation of resources. However, for a population, growth is the increase in popu- lation size across time. Many of the organisms in your backyard - for instance small invertebrtes and weedy plants - have rapid development time, and are able to undergo multiple generations between spring to fall. The environment changes during the course of the growing season, imposing variable natural selection through time. As these populations grow, and eventually decline, they evolve in response to these changing environments.

### DNA as a historical record
We can observe evolutionary change in populations through the analysis of DNA. Because most individuals in a population have slightly different genomes, we can infer the evolutionary history of the population and species. In some cases, such patterns reveal the more distant past, for instance large scale migration events. In other cases, we identify regions of the genome that have recently undergone adaptive evolution. Patterns of variation not only tell the story of the past, but also the present. We can track evolutionary dynamics in real-time. And, we can do it from your backyard.

### Fruit flies and compost piles
Your compost pile is teaming with life, and fruit flies are an important part of that ecosystem. Fruit flies typically eat bacteria and fungi that decompose your scraps, and are therefore part of the decomposition cycles that make the world go around. Over the course of the summer, your pile will likely be inhabited by about a dozen species of fruit flies, in addition to many other flying, walking, and crawling invertebrates. For some species of fruit flies, 10-15 generations can pass between the spring and fall. Populations of fruit flies evolve over the course of the growing season as aspects of the nutritional and thermal environment change. By sampling fruit flies from your compost pile over the growing season, we can track the evolutionary dynamics of fruit flies in real-time.

# Will you commit to sampling and preserving small flying insects from your compost piles 2x per month July - December?
##### \*If you miss a week or two, that's okay!

### Participate in a world-wide effort
Your participation in this project will contribute to an ongoing, international collaboration of fruit fly biologists to study the genomes of flies sampled throughout the world. Your samples will represent a unique contribution from Virginia. Read more about this effort at [http://www.droseu.net](http://www.droseu.net)

## We supply everything you need to participate!
### The Kit
* Drosophila net
* Collection vials
* Preservation tubes
* 75% Ethanol
* Eye dropper
* Specimen labels
* A funnel
* Collection Log
* Collection Manual

Here is an example of a filled collection vial. Flies were collected by gently kicking a compost pile. There are **~50 flies in there, so multiple vials might be necessary to get the requested ~200 flies.**
