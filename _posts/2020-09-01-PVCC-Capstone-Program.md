The Bergland lab is collaborating with students and faculty at Piedmont Virginia Community College to conduct seasonal _Drosophila_ collections at Carter Mountain Orchard in Charlottesville. Students in the Science 299 class will be studying species abundance, behavior, and other aspects of fly biology as independent research projects while contributing to the Bergland lab’s ongoing seasonal field collections. More information about PVCC’s capstone research program is available here: [https://www.ableweb.org/biologylabs/wp-content/uploads/volumes/vol-39/Vondrasek.pdf](https://www.ableweb.org/biologylabs/wp-content/uploads/volumes/vol-39/Vondrasek.pdf)
