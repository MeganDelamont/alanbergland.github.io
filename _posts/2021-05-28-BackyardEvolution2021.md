The Bergland lab is recruiting volunteers for the 2021 Backyard Evolution Citizen Science project. This project aims to collect drosophilid flies form compost piles throughout the growing season. This work is in collaboration with Virginia Master Gardeners, Master Naturalists, the Piedmond-Virginia Community College, and the University of Virginia. This is the second year that we are recruiting volunteers after a successful year in 2020.
