The Bergland lab joined the Central Shenandoah Master Gardeners Association at the Harrisonburg Farmers Market to talk about insects, compost, and evolution. These outreach efforts are geared towards increasing public understanding of evolution an diversity and to promote the Backyard Evolution project. We had a ton of fun and look forward to joining the CSMGVA again soon!
