Members of the Bergland lab and UVA Biology community have helped lead the development of the DEST repository. The DEST repository contains population allele frequency estimates across the genome for 271 population samples collected in ~100 localities in 2 continents over a nearly a decade. This publication also demonstrates that fly populations have endemic mutations and implements methods for demographic inference using PoolSeq data.
