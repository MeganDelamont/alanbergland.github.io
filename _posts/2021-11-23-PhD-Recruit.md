University of Virginia: PhD position in Evolutionary Genetics.

The Bergland lab at the University of Virginia is recruiting a PhD student to work on a NSF funded project study rapid adaptive evolution and meta-population biology of Drosophila over seasonal time-scales. This position will provide training in quantitative and population genetics incorporating field based sampling, laboratory experiments, NGS library prep and data-analysis and will allow the selected student to pursue new and original research questions. This position will also include the development of an outreach program with Citizen Scientists and the opportunity to collaborate in international consortium of Drosophila evolutionary biologists.

Applicants with a background in evolutionary biology, genetics, and genomics are encouraged to apply. Experience with Drosophila or other model systems is encouraged but not necessary.

The Bergland lab is part of the Biology Department at the University of Virginia. Our department has strengths in Evolutionary Biology, Developmental Biology, and Neuroscience and PhD students experience a broad exposure to cutting edge research across these disciplines. PhD students at UVA also have access to a number of unique  fellowship and research grant opportunities.

The University of Virginia is located in Charlottesville, Virginia nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Charlottesville offers ample access to the outdoors, has a vibrant restaurant and night life, and is close to major metropolitan areas.

The deadline to apply for PhD positions in the Biology Depart at UVA is Dec 1, however applications will be considered through December 5.

See https://bio.as.virginia.edu/graduate/how-to-apply for more information.

Please contact Alan Bergland (aob2x@virginia.edu) to discuss the position. Please include a CV and a cover letter addressing your research and educational background to start the conversation.
