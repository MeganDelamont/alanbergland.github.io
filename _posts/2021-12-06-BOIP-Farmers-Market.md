The Bergland Lab ran the Biology Outreach and Inclusion Program (BOIP)'s Farmer's Market Science booth on November 13! Building around the theme "Biodiversity in Your Backyard," we shared knowledge about and looked at some of the model organisms that can be found in our own local, Charlottesville environment! Big thanks to Market Central for hosting us!
